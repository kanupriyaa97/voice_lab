# Voice Forensics Lab
This software aims to analyze audios of humans and give analysis graphs such as waveforms, spectrograms and personality data from it. Organizations can give access to their employees and store multiple audio recordings (.wav form only) in their databases. 

Multiple IBM Watson APIs have been used for the development. The frontend uses jQuery, JavaScript, HTML and CSS. The backend uses Django. The project can be run by opening the src folder in Pycharm and running the command $python manage.py runserver.
